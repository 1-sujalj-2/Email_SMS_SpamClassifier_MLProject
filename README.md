# Email_SMS_SpamClassifier_MLProject
Email/SMS Spam Classifier
This project aims to build a robust classifier to detect spam in email and SMS messages using various machine learning algorithms.

1)Project Overview
Objective: To classify messages as spam or ham (not spam).
Dataset: The dataset contains labeled examples of spam and ham messages.

2)Methodology
1)Data Preprocessing
Text Vectorization: Used Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TFIDF) to convert text data into numerical form.

3)Models Evaluated
1)Multinomial Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB)
2)Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)
3)Support Vector Machine (SVM)
4)Decision Tree Classifier
5)Other classification algorithms

4)Model Selection
Best Model: Multinomial Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB)
Performance Metrics:
Highest accuracy
Highest precision

5)Results
The MultinomialNB model outperformed other algorithms in terms of accuracy and precision, making it the best choice for this classification task.
